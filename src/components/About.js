            Joining the workforce 3 years ago, I have done full-stack
            development for freelancing and corporate setting. I always want to
            be involved from the start and to the end of the project because I
            am confident that I can contribute to any part of the project. I
            like to solve problems, be proactive, work with a team, and be
            assertive. I am also a very committed person and constantly want to
            improve me because I believe when you stop learning that's when you
            stop growing
